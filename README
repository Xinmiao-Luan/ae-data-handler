# AE Data Handler: MATLAB Tools for Acoustic Emission Analysis

This project contains MATLAB functions for reading, merging, filtering and visualizing Acoustic Emission (AE) data collected 
from Directed Energy Deposition (DED) processes. 
It enables streamlined signal processing including timestamp-based selection, waveform plotting, and spectrogram extraction.

## Features

- Batch file reading with header interpretation
- Merge and save raw AE data to a unified format
- Extract data based on specific time ranges
- Plot raw waveforms and overlay multiple channels
- Ready for downstream feature extraction (e.g., STFT, spectrograms)

## File Descriptions

- `readMultipleFiles.m`: Load and merge raw binary AE data from multiple files
- `selectData.m`: Select signal segments by timestamps
- `plotWaveform.m`: Plot AE signals from merged or selected segments
- `ReadWFSDataTrunk.m`, `ReadWFSHeader.m`: Low-level binary file parsers
- `demo.m`: Example script showing how to use all components
- `drawspectrum.m`: Visualizes spectrogram-like features of AE signals 
   across time with optional event overlays and power trend plotting.

## Example Usage is provided in the demo.mat
